This directory contains the scripts for the analysis of "Working Title" by Line Larsdatter.

The directory contains two scripts by Line Larsdatter:
"Boosted_regression_trees" and
"Test_for_correlation"

The script "Boosted_regression_trees" firstly splits the dataset into test- and trainingsets. Boosted regression trees are build and validated by LOOCV. Plots of the single trees from each CV are plottet in the end.

The script "Test_for_correlation" draws a correlation matrix for all accessible variables and runs a spearmans rank correlation analysis on the numeric variables.
